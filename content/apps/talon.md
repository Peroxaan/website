Talon is a simple tool for users to use, manage, and work with Webhooks on Discord, Slack, and IFTTT. It's very easy to use, and allows a larger audience to work with Webhooks in a simple way, without requiring you to know how to code. Talon gets rid of everything complex, and gives you a nice and easy to use Interface thats familiar to use.

We built Talon to take advantage of the features that Discord, Slack, and IFTTT offer. Talon allows you to save and copy your links inside of the app, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth just to use the App. Also with Talon, you can run POST Requests to any service, just in case Talon does not yet offer something you have in mind.

For even more features, you can purchase Talon Pro. Talon Pro is a one time purchase that allows you to shorten links with Talon, using our own in-house [talon.link](http://talon.link) service. Talon Pro will be growing more with future updates.
